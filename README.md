# googleCodeNextSummer2021Hackathon
Summer 2021 -> Friday August 20th - Sunday August 22nd (2nd Hackathon with Google Code Next) In the Summer 2021, 
I joined a team to compete in a Hackathon that had participants from Chelsea, Harlem and Oakland. Our group has members from all three Google Code Next Labs,
and we were team 2 (out of the 13 teams)! We came in 2nd place in the whole hackathon, and here are the files to the project (didn't had the time to add them until now)!
